# FORCE Tool Reorganization Summary

This document summarizes the reorganization of FORCE tools and documentation according to FORCE specifications.

## Tool Script Migration

The following tool scripts have been migrated from the project root to their respective modules under `force/tools`:

1. **Git Tools:**
   - `force_grouped_commit.py` → `force/tools/git/grouped_commit/tool.py`

2. **Documentation Tools:**
   - `force_doc_sync.py` → `force/tools/documentation/doc_sync/tool.py`

3. **Project Tools:**
   - `force_project_migration.py` → `force/tools/project/migration/tool.py`

Each tool module has been structured with:

- A main tool class that encapsulates the tool's functionality
- An `__init__.py` file that exports the tool class
- Tool-specific logic moved into the `tool.py` file

## Documentation Migration

The following documentation files have been moved from the project root into `.force/reports/main/v0.1.1`:

- `FORCE_COMPLETION_REPORT.md`
- `FORCE_DOC_VCS_EXECUTION_REPORT.md`
- `FORCE_GIT_TASK_REPORT.md`
- `FORCE_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`
- `FORCE_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md`
- `FORCE_SUCCESS_REPORT.md`

## Tools Documentation Update

The `FORCE_TOOLS_README.md` has been updated to:

1. Reflect the new organization structure
2. Include programmatic usage examples for each tool
3. Document the directory structure and report generation
4. Follow the FORCE tools documentation specification

## Next Steps

- Update any scripts or programs that reference the old tool paths to use the new module structure
- Create additional tests for the reorganized tools
- Update any CI/CD pipelines to use the new tool structure
