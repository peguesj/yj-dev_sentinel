## 3. Agent Subsystems

### 3.1 Version Control Agents

#### 3.1.1 Version Control Master Agent (VCMA)

The VCMA acts as an autonomous observer of the development process, making decisions about when and how to commit code changes.

**Key Responsibilities:**
- Monitor file system changes in the workspace
- Analyze commit-worthiness of changes
- Group logically related changes
- Generate meaningful commit messages
- Manage branch creation and merging

**Decision Making Algorithm:**
```
function evaluateCommitWorthiness(changes):
    if changes contain compilable/runnable state:
        if changes represent complete feature/fix:
            return HIGH_PRIORITY
        else if changes represent meaningful progress:
            return MEDIUM_PRIORITY
    else if changes > significant_threshold AND time_since_last_commit > max_interval:
        return LOW_PRIORITY
    return NO_COMMIT
```

**State Management:**
The VCMA maintains an internal state model tracking:
- Current branch status
- Files under observation
- Change history
- Commit patterns

#### 3.1.2 Version Control Listener Agent (VCLA)

The VCLA provides a service interface for on-demand VC operations requested by other agents or developers.

**Operation Interface:**
```typescript
interface VCOperation {
  operation: 'commit' | 'branch' | 'merge' | 'push' | 'pull' | 'status' | 'reset' | 'checkout';
  parameters: {
    [key: string]: any;  // Operation-specific parameters
  };
  priority: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low';
  requestor: string;  // ID of requesting agent or developer
  dryRun?: boolean;   // If true, simulate but don't execute
}
```

**Safety Protocols:**
- All destructive operations require confirmation
- Branch protection rules prevent direct pushes to protected branches
- Operations are logged for audit
- Automatic backup of workspace state before risky operations

### 3.2 Documentation Inspection Agents

#### 3.2.1 README Documentation Inspector Agent (RDIA)

The RDIA ensures project documentation remains accurate, comprehensive, and useful.

**Documentation Analysis Process:**
1. Parse README and related documentation files
2. Extract structured sections (installation, usage, API docs)
3. Compare against actual project capabilities
4. Identify gaps, inconsistencies, and outdated information
5. Generate improvement recommendations

**Quality Metrics:**
- Coverage: % of features documented
- Accuracy: % of documentation matching actual functionality
- Clarity: Readability scores of documentation text
- Completeness: Presence of expected sections
- Code example validity: Working status of included examples

#### 3.2.2 Code Documentation Inspector Agent (CDIA)

The CDIA focuses on inline code documentation quality and adherence to standards.

**Documentation Standards Application:**
```
function evaluateDocumentation(codeEntity, entityType, language):
    standardsToApply = loadStandards(language, entityType)
    docString = extractDocString(codeEntity)
    
    evaluations = []
    for standard in standardsToApply:
        compliance = standard.evaluate(docString)
        evaluations.push({standard: standard.name, compliance: compliance})
        
    return generateReport(codeEntity, evaluations)
```

**Improvement Generation:**
The CDIA can generate docstring templates adhering to the appropriate standard (JSDoc, NumPy, Google style, etc.) for missing or incomplete documentation.

### 3.3 Code Quality Agents

#### 3.3.1 Static Analysis Agent (SAA)

The SAA applies static analysis techniques to identify code quality issues, potential bugs, and anti-patterns.

**Capabilities:**
- Linting against configurable rule sets
- Complexity analysis (cyclomatic complexity, etc.)
- Type checking and inference
- Security vulnerability detection
- Performance issue identification

#### 3.3.2 Test Coverage Agent (TCA)

The TCA analyzes and reports on test coverage, identifying under-tested areas of the codebase.

**Metrics Tracked:**
- Line coverage
- Branch coverage
- Function coverage
- Integration test coverage
- Edge case coverage

## 4. Knowledge Management System

The Knowledge Management System is central to Dev Sentinel's ability to learn and improve over time.

### 4.1 Knowledge Structure

### 4.2 Learning Mechanisms

Dev Sentinel employs several learning mechanisms:

1. **Supervised Learning**: Human feedback on agent actions
2. **Reinforcement Learning**: Tracking outcomes of decisions
3. **Pattern Recognition**: Identifying recurring code and solution patterns
4. **Case-Based Reasoning**: Applying solutions from similar past problems
5. **Collaborative Learning**: Sharing insights across agent instances

### 4.3 Knowledge Application Flow

```plantuml
@startuml
!define PROCESS rectangle
!define DATA database
!define DECISION diamond
!define START circle
!define END circle

skinparam backgroundColor transparent

START as S
PROCESS "Agent encounters\nproblem/decision point" as P1

## 5. Communication Protocol

### 5.1 Message Structure

Agents communicate using a standardized message format:

```typescript
interface AgentMessage {
  messageId: string;             // Unique ID for this message
  correlationId: string;         // ID linking related messages
  sender: {
    agentId: string;
    agentType: string;
  };
  recipient: {
    agentId: string;
    agentType: string;
  };
  messageType: MessageType;      // Command, Event, Query, Response, etc.
  priority: Priority;            // Normal, High, Critical
  payload: any;                  // Message-specific content
  timestamp: string;             // ISO timestamp
  expiresAt?: string;           // Optional expiration time
  metadata: {
    [key: string]: any;          // Additional contextual information
  };
}
```

### 5.2 Communication Patterns

Dev Sentinel employs multiple communication patterns:

1. **Request-Response**: Synchronous communications requiring immediate answers
2. **Publish-Subscribe**: Event notifications to interested parties
3. **Command**: Directives to perform specific actions
4. **Query**: Information requests without side effects
5. **Stream**: Continuous updates during long-running processes

### 5.3 Event Bus Architecture

The system uses a central event bus for decoupled communication:

```plantuml
@startuml
!define AGENT rectangle
!define BUS queue
!define SYSTEM rectangle

skinparam backgroundColor transparent

BUS "Event Bus" as EB

AGENT "VC Master\nAgent" as VCMA
AGENT "VC Listener\nAgent" as VCLA
AGENT "README\nInspector" as RDIA
AGENT "Code Doc\nInspector" as CDIA
AGENT "Static Analysis\nAgent" as SAA
AGENT "Task\nCoordinator" as TC
SYSTEM "Developer\nInterface" as DI

VCMA -up-> EB : Publishes
VCLA -up-> EB : Publishes
RDIA -up-> EB : Publishes
CDIA -up-> EB : Publishes
SAA -up-> EB : Publishes
TC -up-> EB : Publishes
DI -up-> EB : Publishes

EB -down-> VCMA : Subscribes
EB -down-> VCLA : Subscribes
EB -down-> RDIA : Subscribes
EB -down-> CDIA : Subscribes
EB -down-> SAA : Subscribes
