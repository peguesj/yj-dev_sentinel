1. **Atomic Operations**
   - Design patterns for atomic, reversible operations
   - Include rollback capabilities where appropriate
   - Provide comprehensive status reporting

2. **Context Awareness**
   - Use context information for intelligent behavior
   - Adapt pattern behavior based on project state
   - Include user feedback and confirmation

### Documentation Standards

1. **Comprehensive Coverage**
   - Document all tools, patterns, and constraints
   - Include usage examples and best practices
   - Maintain up-to-date API documentation

2. **Quality Validation**
   - Use documentation analysis tools regularly
   - Validate cross-references and links
   - Ensure consistency across all documentation
