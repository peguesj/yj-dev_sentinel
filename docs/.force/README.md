## Usage Examples

### Tool Execution
```python
from force import ForceEngine

engine = ForceEngine()

# Execute a git workflow tool
result = await engine.execute_tool(
    tool_id="git_workflow_commit",
    parameters={
        "scope": "feature",
        "semanticVersionIncrement": "minor"
    },
    context={
        "projectPhase": "development",
        "complexityLevel": "medium"
    }
)
```

### Pattern Application
```python
# Apply an agent development workflow pattern
patterns = engine.load_patterns()
workflow_pattern = patterns["agent_development_workflow"]

# Execute pattern steps
for step in workflow_pattern["implementation"]["steps"]:
    await engine.execute_tool(
        tool_id=step["toolId"],
        parameters=step["parameters"]
    )
```

### MCP Integration

  "tool": "force_execute_tool",
  "parameters": {
    "toolId": "documentation_analysis",
    "parameters": {
      "checkLinks": true,
      "generateReport": true

    "dev-sentinel-force": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["-m", "integration.fast_agent.force_mcp_server"],
      "env": {
        "FORCE_DIR": "./docs/.force"
      }
