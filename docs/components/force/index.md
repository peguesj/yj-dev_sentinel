# FORCE Components

This section provides comprehensive documentation for the FORCE framework components.

## Overview

The FORCE (Framework for Orchestrated Reasoning in Code Environments) framework is composed of several core components that work together to provide a flexible, extensible system for automating development tasks.

## Core Components

### [Tools](tools/index.md)

Tools are the executable units of the FORCE framework, designed to perform specific development actions. Each tool is implemented as a self-contained module with defined inputs, outputs, and behaviors.

### [Patterns](patterns/index.md)

Patterns are reusable workflows that combine tools into higher-level operations. They define sequences of tool executions with conditional logic, error handling, and data transformation.

### [Constraints](constraints/index.md)

Constraints define rules and validations that ensure quality, security, and consistency. They are applied before, during, and after tool execution to maintain system integrity.

### [Learning System](learning/index.md)

The learning system improves FORCE operations over time by analyzing execution history, identifying patterns, and optimizing tool and pattern selection.

### [Governance System](governance/index.md)

The governance system enforces policies related to security, resource usage, and compliance. It controls what operations can be performed and under what conditions.

## Integration Points

The FORCE framework integrates with other Dev Sentinel components through:

1. **Agent Interface**: Provides agents with access to FORCE capabilities
2. **Task Manager**: Coordinates task execution across the system
3. **Message Bus**: Facilitates communication between components
4. **External API**: Exposes FORCE capabilities to external tools and systems

## Implementation

The FORCE framework is implemented in the `/force` directory with the following structure:

```bash
force/
├── __init__.py                # Package initialization
├── version.py                 # Version information
├── tool_executor.py           # Tool execution engine
├── legacy_adapter.py          # Adapter for legacy systems
├── yung_integration.py        # Integration with YUNG
├── tools/                     # Tool implementations
│   ├── documentation/         # Documentation tools
│   ├── git/                   # Git-related tools
│   └── project/               # Project management tools
├── patterns/                  # Pattern implementations
├── constraints/               # Constraint implementations
├── learning/                  # Learning system components
└── governance/                # Governance system components
```

## Usage

The FORCE framework can be used directly through its API:

```python
from force.tool_executor import ToolExecutor
from force.version import get_version

# Initialize tool executor
executor = ToolExecutor()

# Execute a tool
result = await executor.execute_tool(
    tool_name="git.grouped_commit",
    parameters={
        "scope": "feature/my-feature",
        "version_increment": "auto"
    }
)
```

## Configuration

The FORCE framework is configured through the `config/fastagent.config.yaml` file:

```yaml
force:
  enabled: true
  log_level: info
  tools:
    documentation:
      enabled: true
    git:
      enabled: true
    project:
      enabled: true
  patterns:
    enabled: true
  constraints:
    enabled: true
    enforcement_level: warn
  learning:
    enabled: true
    history_retention_days: 30
  governance:
    enabled: true
    policy_path: "force/governance/policies"
```
