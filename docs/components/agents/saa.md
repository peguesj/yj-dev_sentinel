# Static Analysis Agent (SAA)

> Version: 0.1.0

## Overview

The Static Analysis Agent (SAA) is responsible for performing automated static code analysis to identify quality issues, potential bugs, security vulnerabilities, and performance problems. It serves as the code quality guardian in the Dev Sentinel system.

## Core Capabilities

### Code Quality Analysis

The SAA analyzes code for quality issues:

- Style guide compliance checking
- Code complexity measurement
- Duplicate code detection
- Unused code identification
- Code formatting verification

### Security Analysis

Identifies potential security vulnerabilities:

- Common vulnerability pattern detection
- Insecure API usage identification
- Input validation issues
- Authentication and authorization checks
- Secure coding practice enforcement

### Performance Analysis

Analyzes code for performance issues:

- Algorithm efficiency checks
- Resource usage analysis
- Memory leak detection
- CPU-intensive pattern identification
- Optimization opportunity discovery

### Integration

Integrates with development workflow:

- Continuous integration checks
- Pre-commit code analysis
- IDE integration
- Historical trend analysis
- Quality gate enforcement

## System Interfaces

### Input Interfaces

The SAA accepts the following inputs:

- Code files for analysis
- Analysis configuration parameters
- Manual analysis requests
- Rule exclusion requests
- CI/CD pipeline integration

### Output Interfaces

The SAA produces the following outputs:

- Analysis reports with issue details
- Quality metrics summaries
- Trend analysis reports
- Rule violation details
- Suggested fixes

## Implementation

The SAA is implemented in `agents/saa/saa_agent.py` and follows the standard Dev Sentinel agent architecture. It extends the base `Agent` class and implements the required interfaces.

### Key Components

- **CodeAnalyzer**: Core analysis engine with rule processing
- **RuleManager**: Manages analysis rules and configurations
- **ReportGenerator**: Creates detailed reports of findings
- **TrendAnalyzer**: Tracks quality metrics over time
- **FixSuggester**: Suggests potential fixes for issues

## Configuration

The SAA can be configured in the `config/fastagent.config.yaml` file:

```yaml
agents:
  saa:
    enabled: true
    analysis_scope:
      - "**/*.py"
      - "**/*.js"
      - "**/*.ts"
    excluded_paths:
      - "node_modules/**"
      - "**/__pycache__/**"
      - "**/*.min.js"
    rules:
      security_level: "high"
      quality_level: "medium"
      performance_level: "low"
    report_formats:
      - "json"
      - "html"
      - "markdown"
```

## Usage

The SAA can be used to analyze code quality:

```python
# Request code analysis
result = await message_bus.request(
    topic="saa.analyze.request",
    message={
        "file_paths": ["src/module.py"],
        "rule_sets": ["security", "quality"],
        "report_format": "markdown"
    },
    response_topic="saa.analyze.response"
)
```
