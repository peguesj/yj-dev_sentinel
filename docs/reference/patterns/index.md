# FORCE Patterns Reference

FORCE patterns define reusable workflows and execution templates that agents can leverage for common tasks. These patterns provide a standardized approach to implementing functionality across the Dev Sentinel ecosystem.

## What are FORCE Patterns?

Patterns in the FORCE system are structured sequences of steps that define a repeatable workflow. They enable consistent execution of complex operations by breaking them down into manageable, well-defined steps. Each pattern consists of:

- **Pattern ID**: A unique identifier for the pattern
- **Name**: A human-readable name
- **Description**: Detailed explanation of the pattern's purpose
- **Steps**: A sequence of operations that comprise the pattern

## Pattern Types

FORCE supports several types of pattern steps:

- **Tool Steps**: Execute specific tools with defined parameters
- **Conditional Steps**: Execute different steps based on conditions
- **Sequential Steps**: Execute a series of steps in order
- **Parallel Steps**: Execute multiple steps simultaneously

## Available Patterns

The following patterns are available in the FORCE system:

- [Code Analysis Pattern](code-analysis.md)
- [Documentation Generation Pattern](documentation-generation.md)
- [Version Control Pattern](version-control.md)
- [Test Generation Pattern](test-generation.md)
- [Refactoring Pattern](refactoring.md)

## Creating Custom Patterns

Custom patterns can be defined programmatically by extending the `PatternStep` base class or by creating JSON pattern definitions. See the [Pattern Development Guide](../../developer/pattern-development.md) for details.

## Pattern Usage

Patterns can be executed through the FORCE API or through the YUNG command interface. For example:

```python
# Execute a pattern programmatically
result = await force_engine.execute_pattern("code-analysis", context={
    "file_path": "path/to/file.py",
    "analysis_depth": "deep"
})
```

Or via YUNG command:

```bash
$FORCE PATTERN RUN code-analysis FILE=path/to/file.py DEPTH=deep
```
