# Test Quality Constraints

Test quality constraints ensure that tests are meaningful, reliable, and maintainable. These constraints help maintain a high standard for the project's test suite.

## Example Constraints

- **Test Naming**: All test functions and classes must follow a consistent naming convention (e.g., `test_*` for functions)
- **Assertion Coverage**: Each test must include at least one assertion
- **Isolation**: Tests should not depend on global state or the outcome of other tests
- **Negative Testing**: Tests should include both positive and negative scenarios
- **Documentation**: Each test should include a docstring describing its purpose

## Violation Example

A test that does not include any assertions or does not follow the naming convention will trigger a violation.

## Enforcement

Test quality constraints are enforced by static analysis tools and during continuous integration runs. Violations are reported and must be addressed before merging changes.
