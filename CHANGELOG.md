## Version Increment Guidelines

This project follows semantic versioning:

- **MAJOR** version when you make incompatible API changes
- **MINOR** version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner
- **PATCH** version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes

### v0.3.0 Classification

This release is classified as a **MINOR** version increment because:
- Significant new functionality was added (tools, patterns, analysis capabilities)
- Existing functionality was enhanced without breaking backward compatibility
- Deprecated components were removed (breaking changes limited to obsolete features)
- New modular architecture maintains compatibility with existing workflows
