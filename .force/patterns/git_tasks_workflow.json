  "description": "Defines the agentic process for handling git operations: add, commit, push, pull, branch, and merge. Ensures atomic commits, clear branch management, and granular logical grouping.",
  "steps": [
    "Determine logical file groupings for staging",
    "Stage changes (git add) per logical group",
    "Review staged changes for each group",
    "Atomic commit (git commit -m) with multiline, referential messages",
    "Include PM/initiative/project/issue/task/subtask references in commit messages",
    "Push to remote (git push)",
    "Branch management (create, switch, merge)",
    "Pull updates (git pull)",
    "Log and benchmark each operation",
    "Run date command to confirm date/time",
    "Get latest tag version (git describe --tags)",
    "Algorithmically determine version increment (major/minor/patch/release)",
    "Apply semantic versioning and/or datestamp tags, namespaced as needed",
    "Update version and document control tables in all updated docs",
    "Update package files with new version",
    "Adhere to agile/scrum documentation and communication best practices",
    "Ensure acceptance criteria are met before marking complete",
    "Maintain high referential integrity for integrations (git, github, jira, slack)",
    "Progressively increase batch size and review telemetry/insights",
    "Update risk tolerance and batch strategy based on performance metrics"
