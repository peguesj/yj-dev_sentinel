## Documentation Update and Pattern Enforcement Report (v0.5.0)

### Actions Taken
- Expanded FORCE.spec.md to fully document the new Variant component, including definition, schema excerpt, usage, and examples.
- Maintained documentation quality and structure consistent with previous standards.
- Attempted to orchestrate enforcement of documentation-generation, version-control, git-tasks-workflow, and branch-end-tasks patterns using MCP Force tools.
- Patterns were not found in the current registry; recommend registering or updating pattern definitions for full automation.

### Learnings from Chat
- Variant is now a first-class Force component for session orchestration and prompt engineering.
- Documentation and schema must evolve together for clarity and developer adoption.
- Pattern enforcement should be automated and patterns registered in the MCP system for future releases.

### Next Steps
- Register missing patterns in the MCP registry.
- Continue atomic, granular documentation and code updates as new components are added.
- Use this report to inform future component and pattern definitions.
