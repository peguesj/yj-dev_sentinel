Learnings from test refactor:
- Enforce snake_case for all parameter names in Python code and tests.
- Always provide all required parameters in tests, matching the expected types.
- Functional programming and robust systems require strict contracts and consistent naming.
- Record these learnings to improve future test and engine design.
