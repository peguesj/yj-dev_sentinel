## Overview

Dev Sentinel is an autonomous development assistant that combines intelligent agents with the FORCE development framework. The system helps automate and streamline development tasks through tools, patterns, constraints, and continuous learning.

**Latest Release (v0.3.0)** brings enhanced Force tools structure, comprehensive git workflow automation, improved MCP server implementations, and modular documentation capabilities.

### Key Components

1. **Dev Sentinel Core**: Event-driven agent system that coordinates development tasks
2. **FORCE Framework**: Modular schema-driven development engine with:
   - **Tools**: Executable development actions
   - **Patterns**: Reusable workflows for common tasks
   - **Constraints**: Quality rules and validations
   - **Learning**: System improvement through execution analysis
   - **Governance**: Policy enforcement for security and compliance
3. **Autonomous Agents**: Specialized agents for version control, documentation, and analysis
4. **Model Context Protocol**: VS Code integration for intelligent assistance

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or later
- Git
- VS Code (for MCP integration)

### Quick Install

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/peguesj/yj-dev_sentinel.git
cd yj-dev_sentinel

# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
# or
.venv\\Scripts\\activate   # Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
