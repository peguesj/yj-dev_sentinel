## Overview

Dev Sentinel is a comprehensive framework for autonomous development agents that work together to streamline software development, enforce best practices, and ensure high-quality documentation. This system consists of specialized agents for version control management, documentation inspection, code quality assurance, and more.

## Architecture Components

- **Version Control Master Agent (VCMA)**: Proactively manages version control operations by observing code changes and making intelligent decisions about when and what to commit.
- **Version Control Listener Agent (VCLA)**: Responds to explicit version control requests from other agents or developers with appropriate validation and safety checks.
- **Code Documentation Inspector Agent (CDIA)**: Evaluates and improves in-code documentation quality across a codebase.
- **README Inspector Agent (RDIA)**: Ensures that project documentation is comprehensive, accurate, up-to-date, and follows best practices.
