# Supabase Edge Function Deployment Success

## Context
Successfully deployed the `generate-embeddings` Edge Function using the `--use-api` flag for web-based Supabase projects.

## Command Used
```bash
supabase functions deploy generate-embeddings --use-api
```

## Output
```
Uploading asset (generate-embeddings): supabase/functions/generate-embeddings/index.ts
Deployed Functions on project iqivodptfhiatllakuap: generate-embeddings
You can inspect your deployment in the Dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/iqivodptfhiatllakuap/functions
```

## Key Learning
- The `--use-api` flag is essential for web-based Supabase projects (not local Docker)
- This flag bypasses the need for Docker and uses the Supabase API directly
- Deployment was successful and function is responding to requests
- Function correctly validates required parameters: contentId, contentType, text

## Testing Result
The Edge Function is operational and returns appropriate error messages when required parameters are missing, confirming it's properly deployed and configured.

## Status
✅ Edge Function deployment: SUCCESSFUL
✅ Function validation: WORKING
✅ API endpoint: ACCESSIBLE
